                    <li><b>June 5, 1991:</b> Playing in his first NBA Finals, Jordan rises up in the paint to dunk, switching hands midair for an acrobatic layup against the Lakers. “The Move” helps propel the Bulls to their first NBA title.</li>
                    <li><b>June 3, 1992:</b> Jordan makes six three-point shots in the first half of Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, turning to the crowd and shrugging his shoulders. The Bulls win the series in six games</li>
                    <li><b>June 20, 1993:</b>Jordan has 33 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, but it’s John Paxson who makes the game-winning three-pointer in the Bulls’ 99-98 win over the Phoenix Suns for title No. 3. Jordan is Finals MVP for the third time in a row.</li>
                    <li><b>June 16, 1996:</b>The Bulls cap a postseason in which they lost only three times by beating the Seattle SuperSonics 87-75. Jordan wins his fourth Finals MVP.</li>
